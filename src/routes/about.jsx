                <h1>ABOUT STATE SOLEIL</h1>
                <p>State Soleilâ€™s floral design studio was founded on the principles of Timelessness of Romance and Tasteful Traditions. We are true romantics here - we want to hear your love story as each is exceptionally unique. We are naturally pulled to the Old World aesthetic and have deep appreciation for the preservation of tradition. We care deeply about the attention to detail of your event and do not accept more than one booking per week. This allows us to focus solely on you and your needs. Here at State Soleil, we prioritize quality over everything.</p>
